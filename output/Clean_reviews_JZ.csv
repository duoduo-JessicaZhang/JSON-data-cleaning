"The app is amazing and I love the expanded ability to included personal info in the scheduled messages. There’s a few things I really want that are not on the app and one is the ability to manually check a guest out of your unit so it allows you to leave a review and change automatically into new daily guests. Otherwise having to wait until 12-3 pm to leave a review after I’ve completed all checkout/check in tasks for the next guest and then having to come back later is a little annoying. Also, if there’s a way to turn off notifications for “_____ is arriving in 12 days” that’d be great. Additionally, I’d love to be able to utilize IF functions for shortcode messages. For example, if I try and attach a shortcode message and include something like the guests home city (“safe travels from /guest_city/!”) but the guests profile doesn’t have that information to pull, it shows as “/guest_city/“ in the message to the guest and I would like to be able to attach an if statement to drop part of the phrase if the info isn’t available (or warn me that it’s not filling it in bc it’s missing that data so I can fix it myself, otherwise I often miss it if I’m not diligent!). This would help avoid a lot of problems.",1219,appstore7516268448,2021-06-28T17:41:44Z,2021-12-14T16:17:42.800Z,False,0.995285456775087,Adam_56,"Love the app as a host, but is missing one key feature for hosts",Personalization,True,5,5,Airbnb,,appstore401626263,7516268448,False,appstore
"I like some of the initial interface. The score right away.  It is the best for the money in my opinion.  But For the money, it should have current, not old, transunion and equifax scores.  Also, it’s very difficult to get full score info, i.e. current report info to see what exactly is going on, lender by mender.  This should include which balances are changing.  Also, there should be a way to contact experian real time to have interaction about issues. Also know how often updates will happen.    In this time of global financial stress, the credit agencies should be a bit more lax about lowering people’s scores for balance increases.  Of course our balances are going up.    Even I, as an essential (food) business owner, am intelligently availing myself and the business of deferral opportunities, which are essential to our survival in this environment.    But on the whole this is a better app than credit karma, transunion, or equifax.",948,appstore5867864769,2020-04-26T20:25:12Z,2021-12-08T16:09:02.596Z,False,0.639355437930958,Differentways,Good could be better,Financial,True,3,5,Experian,,appstore1087101090,5867864769,False,appstore
"I’ve been using Duolingo for a while now to practice my French, and in the time I have had the app I have tried out several other languages too (including Spanish, Russian, German, Klingon, etc.). The games make learning fun and the teaching style helps keep the terms and sentence structures ingrained in my memory very well!  My only request/hope for this app (not a complaint, I love the app) is that while I appreciate the inclusion of fictional languages like High Valyrian and Klingon, I would like for there to be more significant languages to be added to Duolingo’s roster of classes as well. Widely-spoken languages like Arabic and Bengali are noticeably absent on the course list (for English-speakers, not sure about others), as well as Finnish, which is a little strange because Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish are all present. Personally, as someone whose family comes from the western Balkans, I would love to see a language course on Serbo-Croatian, since it is a difficult language that I believe Duolingo would be an excellent tool to help me to become better at it. Recently, Hawaiian and Navajo were added to the roster, which excites me and makes me hope for these languages to be added sometime in the future as well.   Overall, I love the app and will continue using it to study foreign languages! I look forward to seeing more language courses added in future updates! 👍",1392,appstore3307601343,2018-10-16T08:44:38Z,2021-12-15T19:20:25.381Z,False,0.621504568527776,User name unavailable,"Excellent App, but could use more Languages!",gamification,True,5,5,Duolingo,,appstore570060128,3307601343,False,appstore
I like the Nike App even though some of the colors they advertise are too flamboyant for my taste.
