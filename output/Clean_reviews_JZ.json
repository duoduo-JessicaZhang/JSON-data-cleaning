There\u2019s a few things I really want that are not on the app and one is the ability to manually check a guest out of your unit so it allows you to leave a review and change automatically into new daily guests. Otherwise having to wait until 12-3 pm to leave a review after I\u2019ve completed all checkout/check in tasks for the next guest and then having to come back later is a little annoying. Also, if there\u2019s a way to turn off notifications for \u201c_____ is arriving in 12 days\u201d that\u2019d be great. Additionally, I\u2019d love to be able to utilize IF functions for shortcode messages. For example, if I try and attach a shortcode message and include something like the guests home city (\u201csafe travels from /guest_city/!\u201d) but the guests profile doesn\u2019t have that information to pull, it shows as \u201c/guest_city/\u201c in the message to the guest and I would like to be able to attach an if statement to drop part of the phrase if the info isn\u2019t available (or warn me that it\u2019s not filling it in bc it\u2019s missing that data so I can fix it myself, otherwise I often miss it if I\u2019m not diligent!).

The score right away.  It is the best for the money in my opinion.  But For the money, it should have current, not old, transunion and equifax scores.  Also, it\u2019s very difficult to get full score info, i.e. current report info to see what exactly is going on, lender by mender.  This should include which balances are changing.  Also, there should be a way to contact experian real time to have interaction about issues. Also know how often updates will happen.    In this time of global financial stress, the credit agencies should be a bit more lax about lowering people\u2019s scores for balance increases.  Of course our balances are going up.

The games make learning fun and the teaching style helps keep the terms and sentence structures ingrained in my memory very well!  My only request/hope for this app (not a complaint, I love the app) is that while I appreciate the inclusion of fictional languages like High Valyrian and Klingon, I would like for there to be more significant languages to be added to Duolingo\u2019s roster of classes as well. Widely-spoken languages like Arabic and Bengali are noticeably absent on the course list (for English-speakers, not sure about others), as well as Finnish, which is a little strange because Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish are all present. Personally, as someone whose family comes from the western Balkans, I would love to see a language course on Serbo-Croatian, since it is a difficult language that I believe Duolingo would be an excellent tool to help me to become better at it. Recently, Hawaiian and Navajo were added to the roster, which excites me and makes me hope for these languages to be added sometime in the future as well.   Overall, I love the app and will continue using it to study foreign languages! I look forward to seeing more language courses added in future updates! \ud83d\udc4d", "review_rating": 5, "review_rating_alt": 5, "app_name": "Duolingo", "syndication_flag": false, "date_scraped": "2021-12-15T19:20:25.381Z", "_rand": 0.621504568527776, "possible_dupe": false, "processed_flag": true, "review_text_len": 1392, "app_type": "gamification"}, {"_id": "google_play_storegp:AOqpTOG46Fto2wxF9d9NK6RMwiRPuMMgneTFl2hMjpnmIWujMvnUYigpgKrT71GsLcOjtBNg539D4efSqnOXWg", "review_id": "gp:AOqpTOG46Fto2wxF9d9NK6RMwiRPuMMgneTFl2hMjpnmIWujMvnUYigpgKrT71GsLcOjtBNg539D4efSqnOXWg", "user_nickname": "Carl Todd Jr", "review_text": "I like the Nike App even though some of the colors they advertise are too flamboyant for my taste.
